### **Milestone 1: User Authentication & Calendar Integration**

* **Issue #1: Implement Google OAuth for User Login**

    Users should be able to sign up for and log into the application using their Google account. This will serve as the primary method for authentication, providing a secure and seamless entry point into the app. The system should handle both new user registration and returning user login through this single Google OAuth flow.

* **Issue #2: Allow Connecting Multiple Google Accounts**

    After the initial login, users must have the ability to connect additional Google accounts through a settings interface. This is crucial for users who manage multiple calendars (e.g., personal and work). The application needs to securely store the credentials for each connected account to access their calendars collectively.

* **Issue #3: Display Upcoming Calendar Events**

    The application needs a main dashboard or view that aggregates and displays all upcoming events from all connected Google Calendars. This unified view should present event details clearly, such as the meeting title, date, and start/end times, giving the user a complete picture of their schedule.

* **Issue #4: Implement Notetaker Toggle for Events**

    Next to each upcoming event listed in the calendar view, there must be a toggle switch. This allows the user to decide on a per-meeting basis whether they want the AI notetaker to attend and record the session. The user's choice for each event must be saved and easily changed before the meeting starts.

### **Milestone 2: Meeting Processing with recall.ai**

* **Issue #5: Integrate with recall.ai API**

    The application must be connected to the Recall.ai service using the provided API key. This integration is the core of the meeting processing workflow, and the application should be ableto make authenticated requests to create and manage notetaker bots.

* **Issue #6: Automatically Send Notetaker Bot to Meetings**

    When a calendar event is approaching and its "notetaker" toggle is enabled, the application must automatically parse the event details to find a meeting link (e.g., for Zoom). It will then schedule a Recall.ai bot to join that link a configurable number of minutes before the meeting begins. The app needs to keep a record of the specific bot ID for each scheduled meeting.

* **Issue #7: Poll recall.ai for Meeting Media**

    Because webhooks from the shared Recall.ai account cannot be used, the application must implement a polling mechanism. It should periodically check on the status of the specific bot IDs it has created. Once polling confirms that a meeting has ended and the transcript/media is available, the app should mark the meeting as ready for post-processing.

### **Milestone 3: Post-Meeting Features**

* **Issue #8: Display a List of Past Meetings**

    A dedicated section of the app should display a list of all past meetings that have been successfully processed. Each item in the list should be clearly identifiable, showing information like attendees, start time, and a logo representing the meeting platform (Zoom, Google Meet, etc.).

* **Issue #9: Meeting Details View**

    Users must be able to click on any meeting from the "Past Meetings" list to open a detailed view. This view will act as a central hub for all information related to that specific meeting, starting with the full, unabridged meeting transcript.

* **Issue #10: AI-Generated Follow-Up Email**

    Within the meeting details view, the application will use AI to analyze the full transcript and automatically generate a draft of a follow-up email. This email should recap the key points and action items discussed during the meeting, ready for the user to review and send.

* **Issue #11: AI-Generated Social Media Post**

    The meeting details view must also feature a suggested social media post generated by AI from the meeting's content. This post will be tailored for marketing or informational purposes. It should include a "Copy" button for easy sharing and a "Post" button to publish it directly.

### **Milestone 4: Social Media Integration & Automation**

* **Issue #12: Connect LinkedIn and Facebook Accounts**

    On the settings page, users must be able to securely connect their LinkedIn and Facebook accounts via OAuth. This will grant the application the necessary permissions to post content on their behalf when they choose to do so.

* **Issue #13: Create a Settings Page**

    A dedicated settings page is required where users can manage their preferences. This page will host the controls for connecting social media accounts and, crucially, allow the user to configure the number of minutes before a meeting the notetaker bot should join.

* **Issue #14: Configure Social Media Post Automations**

    Users should be able to create "Automations" to customize how their social media content is generated. This involves creating a rule where they can specify a platform (LinkedIn or Facebook) and provide a custom prompt or instruction to guide the AI in creating posts that match their desired tone and style for that platform.

* **Issue #15: Post to Social Media**

    This feature makes the "Post" button fully functional. When a user clicks it, the application should use the stored credentials for the relevant social media platform (LinkedIn or Facebook) to publish the AI-generated post directly to the user's feed.
